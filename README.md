The RUS Ticket System is designed to make technician's lives easier. Inspired by the complexity and frustration our team of UNC Charlotte technicians experience with our current ticketing system, RUS offers a fast and user-friendly experience. Created using Ruby on Rails, Slim, and SASS for a semester-long class project.
